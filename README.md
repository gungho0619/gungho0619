### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 Regarding my availability, I can commit more than 40 hours per week and I am actually working in client's time zone so we can make more than 6 ~ 8 hours of overlapping time every day. 🏋️‍♀️
- While working as a Web Developer I have strong knowledge and enough experience with different JavaScript frameworks and libraries and was able to complete more than 10 complex websites and web applications using them.
